# React Portfolio

## Description
A portfolio website that displays my work to visitors so they can have the opportunity to reach out if they would like to work together on future projects. It's important to showcase one's work to the rest of the world because it opens a world full of opportunities for collaboration. This way, we all learn from each other and make the web better together. By building this portfolio website, I learned that although React can be complex, it can make front-end development simpler.
